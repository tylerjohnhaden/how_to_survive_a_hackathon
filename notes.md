> refresh | Defines a time interval for the document to refresh itself.
>
> Example: 
>```html
><meta http-equiv="refresh" content="300">
>```
> Note: The value "refresh" should be used carefully, as it takes the control of a page away from the user. Using "refresh" will cause a failure in W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.

This would not pass [W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php)!
